# Medhastra

Intelligent Diagnostics for Modern Medicine

## Overview

Medhastra is an advanced diagnostic platform that helps healthcare professionals analyze patient cases through a causal inference approach. The system provides evidence-based diagnoses and treatment plans by analyzing relationships between medical factors.

## Key Features

- **Causal Inference Analysis**: Identifies relationships between symptoms and conditions
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays diagnostic reasoning through intuitive graphs
- **Evidence-Based Treatment Options**: Categorizes treatments based on efficacy
- **PDF Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive documentation
- **Patient-Specific Planning**: Tailors treatment recommendations to individual needs

## Workflow

Medhastra uses a three-stage diagnostic approach:

1. **Patient Case Analysis**: Extract medical factors and identify causal relationships
2. **Diagnosis**: Perform counterfactual analysis to confirm the most likely diagnosis
3. **Treatment Planning**: Develop a comprehensive, patient-specific treatment plan

Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a thorough diagnostic process that considers all relevant factors.
