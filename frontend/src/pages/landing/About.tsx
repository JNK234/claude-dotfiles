              - Data Flow: Team member data (name, title, description, image) is hardcoded here. Could be fetched from an API in the future.
              - Styling: Uses Tailwind CSS for layout and styling. Framer Motion for hover animations.
              - Images: Sourced from the /public directory. Ensure images are optimized. Placeholder used for members without photos.
              - Integration: Part of the About page, showcasing the founding team.
              - Future Extensions: Could be refactored into a reusable TeamMemberCard component. Data could be managed via state or fetched dynamically.

                  Our founders bring together a rich blend of professional expertise across the world. One began
                  their career as an engineer at Boeing, developing complex systems where precision and safety
                  are non-negotiable. Another is a practicing internal medicine physician with firsthand experience
                  navigating the complexities of patient care and chronic disease management. The third is a
                  surgery resident, combining clinical insight with a passion for hands-on, high-stakes
                  decision-making. Together, our varied backgrounds drive a shared vision for transforming
                  healthcare delivery.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  We initially connected through a project focused on identifying reasoning flaws in large language
                  models, drawn together by our complementary skills and shared work ethic. What began as an
                  academic exercise quickly evolved as we recognized a critical gap: while many companies were
                  building AI for healthcare, few were creating solutions that truly understood and supported the
                  physician's reasoning process.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Our conversations moved beyond the classroom as we shared our frustrations with existing
                  tools. The physicians described the cognitive burden of documentation and diagnosis with
                  inadequate support. Our engineer saw parallels to how systems thinking had transformed
                  aviation safety and efficiency.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  The more we talked, the clearer our vision became. We didn't want to create just another
                  medical reference tool or black-box algorithm. We wanted to build something that thought like a
                  doctor but worked at digital speedâ€”a true clinical reasoning partner that would reduce
                  administrative burden while preserving the physician's central role in healthcare.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Medhastra was born from this vision: an AI assistant built by doctor-engineers who understand
                  both the science of medicine and the art of engineering. Our diverse backgrounds give us a
                  unique ability to bridge clinical needs with technical possibilities, creating solutions that work in
                  the real world of healthcare.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Today, we're bringing that vision to life with a team that has expanded but remains true to our
                  founding principle: AI should enhance rather than replace the physician's role, making
                  healthcare more efficient, accessible, and effective for everyone.
