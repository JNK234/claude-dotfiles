the extracted key nodes, your task is to establish the causal relationships between them. Follow these
steps:

Identify Direct Causal Links
For each symptom, identify the most probable direct cause (e.g., "Massive hematemesis ‚Üí
Esophageal varices").
For each diagnosis, identify what directly led to its development.
For each treatment, specify what it directly influences.
Identify Confounders
Identify any factors that influence both a cause and an effect, potentially misleading the diagnosis.
Example: Cirrhosis affects both esophageal varices and coagulopathy, making it a confounder in
bleeding severity.
Identify Mediators
Identify any stepwise dependencies where one factor leads to another before reaching the final
outcome.
Example: Liver dysfunction ‚Üí Impaired clotting ‚Üí Uncontrolled bleeding (impaired clotting is the
mediator).
Identify Possible Instrumental Variables (IVs) for Diagnosis
Are there any factors that influence treatment selection but not the disease itself?

1. Confirm Readiness to Proceed
Review the available information:
Are all required symptoms, history, tests, and interventions present?
Are any critical data points missing?
If missing, pause and generate follow-up questions before proceeding.

2. Identify Direct Causes of Symptoms
For each symptom, identify the most direct possible cause using the causal graph.
Example:
Severe upper GI bleeding ‚Üí Possible cause: Esophageal varices OR Peptic ulcer
Hypotension ‚Üí Possible cause: Blood loss OR Sepsis OR Heart failure

3. Expand Causal Chains to Find Root Causes
For each direct cause, determine what could have led to that condition.
Example:
Esophageal varices ‚Üí Portal hypertension ‚Üí Cirrhosis
Severe sepsis ‚Üí UTI or pneumonia or bloodstream infection
Repeat this process until a root cause is identified (e.g., Cirrhosis in this case).

4. Identify Confounders and Mediators
Confounders: Are there factors that affect both cause and effect?
Example: Liver disease affects both coagulation and GI bleeding severity (confounder).
Mediators: Are there intermediate steps linking cause and effect?
Example: Portal hypertension ‚Üí Esophageal varices ‚Üí GI bleeding (mediators).

5. Use Counterfactual Reasoning to Validate Diagnosis
Ask "what if" questions to test causal reasoning:
If the patient did NOT have symptom X, would the diagnosis change?
If symptom Y were absent, would a different cause be more likely?
If a treatment (e.g., blood transfusion) fixes the symptom, what does that imply about the root
cause?

If critical data is missing, pause and generate follow-up questions before proceeding.
‚úÖ Do you have all essential medical details for reasoning? If yes, continue.
‚ùå If no, list the missing elements and generate follow-up questions.

2. Test "What If" Scenarios on Symptoms
Consider the absence of a key symptom and predict how it would affect the diagnosis.
Ask:
If Symptom X were missing, would the diagnosis change?
Would another condition now be more likely?
Which causal pathway is weakened or eliminated?
Example:
If the patient had GI bleeding but NOT hypotension, would cirrhosis still be the most probable
cause?
If jaundice were absent, would liver failure still be a likely factor?
üîπ List each tested symptom and its effect on diagnosis.

3. Test the Effect of Interventions
Consider whether a treatment changes symptoms as expected.
Ask:
If a particular treatment resolved the condition, what does that imply about the cause?
If the treatment had no effect, does that rule out a suspected cause?
Example:
If blood transfusion stabilizes the patient, does that confirm the primary cause was acute blood
loss?
If IV antibiotics do NOT improve the condition, does that weaken the likelihood of sepsis?
üîπ List each tested intervention and its effect on diagnosis.

4. Consider the Impact of Test Results
Evaluate whether the presence or absence of specific test results changes the diagnosis.
Ask:
If the test result for X was abnormal, how would that affect the causal graph?
If the test result was normal, would it weaken a particular causal path?
Example:
If liver enzymes are normal, does that weaken the cirrhosis diagnosis?
If the endoscopy does NOT show varices, does that eliminate portal hypertension as a cause?

üîπ List each tested test result and its effect on diagnosis.
5. Rank the Adjusted Diagnoses Based on Counterfactual Testing
Based on the above symptom, intervention, and test counterfactuals, update the diagnosis
rankings.

Review Patient-Specific Factors Before Proceeding
Before reasoning about treatment, ensure you have all relevant patient information that could affect
treatment selection. Review:
Confirmed Diagnosis (from previous steps)
Patient Age & Gender
Comorbidities & Medical History
Current Medications
Allergies & Contraindications
Organ Function (e.g., Liver, Kidney, Heart Status)
Severity of Condition (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Emergency)
üìå If any of this information is missing, generate follow-up questions before proceeding.

Patient Details:
Diagnosis: Esophageal varices with acute GI bleeding.
Age & Gender: 55-year-old male.
Comorbidities: Cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C), Type 2 Diabetes, Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage
3).
Current Medications: Spironolactone, Furosemide, Metformin.
Allergies: None known.
Organ Function: Severe liver dysfunction, moderate kidney impairment.
Severity: Emergency (active bleeding, hypotension).
Construct a Causal Graph for Treatment Impact
Map out the causal relationships between the disease, symptoms, and treatment options.
Identify how each treatment affects the causal pathway (direct or indirect impact).
Determine if a treatment disrupts the disease mechanism or just alleviates symptoms.

How to analyze this graph?
‚úÖ Beta-blockers reduce variceal pressure but are not useful in active bleeding.
‚úÖ TIPS directly relieves portal hypertension, but has contraindications in liver failure.
‚úÖ Endoscopic banding immediately stops bleeding but does not prevent recurrence.
‚ùå Blood transfusion only replaces lost blood but does not fix the cause.

Format Example:
Causal Graph Analysis:
1. TIPS Procedure ‚Üí ‚úÖ Directly reduces portal hypertension, treating the root cause.
2. Endoscopic Banding ‚Üí ‚úÖ Stops active bleeding but does not prevent future episodes.
3. Beta-blockers ‚Üí ‚úÖ Prevents recurrence but does not treat active bleeding.
4. Blood Transfusion ‚Üí ‚ùå Temporary measure; does not treat the underlying disease.
Evaluate Treatment Impact Based on Patient Condition
Can the patient safely undergo the most effective treatment?
Are there any contraindications or organ function concerns?
What happens if a treatment is delayed or omitted?

üìå Example Analysis Based on the Patient's Condition:
Patient-Specific Treatment Considerations:
TIPS Procedure: High risk due to severe liver dysfunction; hepatic encephalopathy is a major
concern.
Endoscopic Banding: Best for immediate bleeding control and feasible given current condition.
Beta-blockers: Safe, but should be introduced only after acute bleeding is controlled.
Blood Transfusion & IV Fluids: Necessary for stabilization, but not a definitive treatment.
Test Counterfactuals for Treatment Selection
Now, simulate "What if" scenarios to validate treatment impact:
What if the patient receives Treatment X but not Treatment Y?
What if Treatment Z is delayed?
Would the disease outcome change significantly?

üìå Example Counterfactual Tests:
What if the patient does not undergo TIPS?
Prediction: Increased risk of future bleeding, but avoids encephalopathy.
What if beta-blockers are given before controlling bleeding?
Prediction: Could cause hypotension, worsening shock.
What if only endoscopic banding is done without other interventions?
Prediction: Immediate bleeding control but risk of rebleeding remains.

Format Example:
Counterfactual Analysis:
1. Without TIPS ‚Üí High risk of future variceal bleeding.
2. Without Endoscopic Banding ‚Üí Acute bleeding continues, high mortality risk.
3. Without Beta-blockers ‚Üí Increased recurrence risk but no immediate effect.
4. Delaying Blood Transfusion ‚Üí Increased hypovolemic shock risk.
Prioritize the Best Treatment Plan
Based on the causal graph, patient condition, and counterfactual reasoning, rank the treatments:

üìå Example Final Treatment Plan:
Final Treatment Recommendation:
- Endoscopic Banding ‚Äì Most immediate and effective for active bleeding.
- Blood Transfusion + IV Fluids ‚Äì Supports hemodynamic stability.
- Beta-blockers (after bleeding control) ‚Äì Reduces long-term recurrence risk.
- TIPS Procedure (if patient is stable & indicated later) ‚Äì Best long-term prevention but high risk
now.
Why this ranking? ‚úÖ Banding is the best immediate solution.
‚úÖ Transfusion stabilizes the patient before further interventions.
‚úÖ Beta-blockers are effective for prevention but must be introduced later.
‚ùå TIPS is ideal for long-term control but is risky given current liver function.
