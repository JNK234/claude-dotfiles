# Review and Update Plans

1. **Read plan.md** - understand the intended direction by checking out the plan @PLAN-PROGRESS/plsn.md. 
2. **Scan the codebase** - see what actually exists vs what was planned
3. **Identify gaps and problems**:
   - What's broken or missing?
   - What technical debt is blocking progress?
   - What assumptions were wrong?
4. **Check if we're still on track** - are the original goals still valid and achievable?
5. **Update plan.md** - revise roadmap based on current reality
6. **Update todo.md** - prioritize immediate fixes and next steps
