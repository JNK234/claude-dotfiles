# Supabase Authentication Sync Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the synchronization between Supabase Authentication and the local backend database for Medhastra AI.

## Architecture Overview

The implemented solution follows a synchronized approach where:

1. **Supabase** handles authentication (signup, login, token management)
2. **Local Backend** stores user data, profiles, and application data

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│  Supabase   │      │  Frontend   │      │  Local Backend  │
│  Auth       │◄────►│  (React)    │◄────►│  (FastAPI)      │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
                                                   ▲
                                                   │
                                                   ▼
                                          ┌─────────────────┐
                                          │  Database       │
                                          │  (PostgreSQL)   │
                                          └─────────────────┘
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. Frontend Implementation

#### AuthContext.tsx

The `AuthContext.tsx` has been enhanced to:
- Fetch user data from Supabase upon authentication
- Create or update user records in the local backend
- Ensure proper profile creation and linking
- Set authentication state based on synchronized user data

The key method `fetchAndSetUser()` now:
1. Gets Supabase user data first
2. Checks if the user exists in the backend database
3. Creates the user in the backend if it doesn't exist
4. Creates or retrieves the user profile
5. Sets authentication state once synchronization is complete

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### User Model

The `User` model has been updated to include:
- First name and last name fields
- Optional hashed_password (for Supabase auth)
- is_onboarded flag
- Auth provider tracking
- Other metadata fields to match Supabase user data

#### Sync Endpoint

A new endpoint at `/api/auth/users/sync` has been added to:
- Receive Supabase user data from the frontend
- Validate the Supabase JWT token
- Create or update user records in the local database
- Handle various error conditions and edge cases

#### User Schema

The user schema has been enhanced to:
- Make password optional for external auth providers
- Include additional fields from Supabase
- Validate user data based on auth provider

## Authentication Flow

1. **User Sign Up**:
   - User signs up via Supabase Auth
   - Email verification is handled by Supabase
   - On successful verification, user is redirected to the app

2. **Authentication**:
   - Frontend checks for Supabase session
   - If session exists, backend sync is triggered
   - User and profile records are created/updated in the local backend
   - Authentication state is set to true in the frontend

3. **Profile Management**:
   - User profiles are automatically created when a user is synchronized
   - Profile data can be extended with application-specific fields

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:
- Failed backend sync doesn't prevent authentication if Supabase auth succeeds
- Detailed logging for debugging authentication issues
- Graceful handling of failed API calls

## Testing

The authentication flow can be tested by:
1. Creating a new account through Supabase
2. Verifying email
3. Confirming successful login and redirect to the main app
4. Checking backend database for synced user and profile records

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:
- Implementing a message queue for high-scale applications
- Adding caching for frequently accessed user data
- Enhanced conflict resolution for edge cases

## Benefits of This Implementation

This synchronized approach gives Medhastra AI:
1. Robust authentication via Supabase
2. Complete control over user data in the local database
3. Efficient queries between users and medical case data
4. Flexibility for future customizations to the user model
5. Simplified user management for administrators
