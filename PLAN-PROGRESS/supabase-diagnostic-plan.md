# Supabase Integration Diagnostic & Fix Plan

## Overview

**Objective**: Diagnose and fix Supabase integration issues blocking development progress using Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

**Current Problem**: `supabase._sync.client.SupabaseException: Invalid API key` preventing test execution and development workflow.

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Blocking all streaming implementation progress

**Approach**: Systematic diagnosis → isolated testing → incremental fixes → integration validation

## Problem Analysis

### Identified Issues
1. **Invalid API Key Error**: Supabase client initialization failing during module import
2. **Configuration Dependencies**: Tests failing due to Supabase initialization in global scope
3. **Mixed Configuration Patterns**: Legacy and new settings causing confusion
4. **Environment Dependencies**: Tests require external Supabase instance

### Root Cause Assessment
- Configuration loaded at module import time (line 30 in supabase.py)
- Missing or invalid environment variables
- Circular dependency issues in test imports
- Lack of development/test environment separation

## TDD Implementation Plan
